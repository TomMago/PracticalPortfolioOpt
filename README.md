Optimizing Markowitz Portfolios with bootstrapping, based on:

Bai, Z. & Liu, Huixia & Wong, Wing-Keung. (2010). Making Markowitz's Portfolio Optimization Theory Practically Useful. SSRN Electronic Journal. 10.2139/ssrn.900972. 

For large amounts of stocks markowitz portfolios overestimate the optimal return whick can be tried to correct by bootstrapping.
The effect is much stronger for the anlytical solution due to inverting the covariance matrix.

This script has methods for calculating the classical and bootstraped portfolio allocation and plot the efficency curve.
